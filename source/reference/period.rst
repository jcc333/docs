.. class:: Period

TempoIQ supports two different formats for expressing time periods as strings:
Simple format and ISO 8601 durations.

Simple Format
-------------

Specify a period with a number and a unit of time, e.g. `6hour` or `1day`.
The supported time units are:

* min - Minutes
* hour - Hours
* day - Days
* month - Months
* year - Years


ISO 8601 Duration Format
------------------------

ISO 8601's duration format allows for specifying more complex periods.
For example:

* 6hour is represented as ``PT6H``
* 1day is represented as ``P1D``
* 1 minute and 15 seconds is represented as ``PT1M15S``, or more concisely ``PT75S``
* 2 weeks is represented as ``P2W``

For a detailed description of the duration format, see the
`ISO 8601 Wikipedia page <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations>`_.


API Libraries
-------------

TempoIQ's libraries may use language-specific Period implementations. See the
library's documentation for details.
