.. class:: WriteRequest

Contains sensor data to write to TempoIQ.

A WriteRequest is a map of device keys to their associated
sensor data. Each device's sensor data is itself a map from
the sensor key to an array of :class:`DataPoint`\ s for that sensor. In JSON,
this looks like::

    {
      "device1": {
        "sensor1": [
          { "t": "2014-04-01T05:00:00.000Z", "v": 17.2 },
          { "t": "2014-04-01T05:01:00.000Z", "v": 33.4 },
          { "t": "2014-04-01T05:02:00.000Z", "v": 38.5 }
        ],
        "sensor2": [
          { "t": "2014-04-01T05:00:00.000Z", "v": 3.2 },
          { "t": "2014-04-01T05:01:00.000Z", "v": 24.5 },
          { "t": "2014-04-01T05:02:00.000Z", "v": 19.3 }
        ]
      }
    }


Client libraries may offer convenience methods and shortcuts for
constructing WriteRequests.

A single WriteRequest can contain DataPoints for many devices and sensors.
When possible, it's recommended to aggregate many DataPoints into a single
WriteRequest instead of sending many small requests. This can increase write
throughput dramatically.
