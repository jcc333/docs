.. class:: Fold

    Folds are used in several pipeline functions to reduce many raw data points
    to a single representative value. TempoIQ supports the following folds:

       * mean - Simple average of values in each period
       * sum - Sum of values
       * min - Minimum value
       * max - Maximum value
       * stddev - Standard deviation
       * variance - Variance, or sum of squares
       * count - Total number of datapoints in each period
       * range - Maximum value less the minimum value
       * first - First data point in each period
       * last - Last data point in each period
