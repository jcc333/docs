Getting Started
===============

This guide introduces the basic TempoIQ API operations you will use to build
your sensor application. You can follow along with one of our 
:doc:`official libraries </sdk/index>`, or via the command line with ``curl``.

Connecting to your backend
--------------------------

Regardless of how you're communicating with your backend, the first step is 
to find your host and :class:`Credentials`. They can be found at the 
bottom of the `development console <https://developers.tempoiq.com/console/>`_:

When using a library, you instantiate a client object with your host, key, and 
secret. When interacting directly via HTTPS, the credentials must be included with
every request.

Creating a device
-----------------

Next, create a device 'thermostat.0' with two sensors: temperature and humidity. 

In addition to sensors, it's also possible to add metadata to devices in the 
form of attributes. You can query devices based on attributes, allowing you 
to perform operations on many devices at once.

Writing sensor data
-------------------

Write data to a sensor in the form of a sequence of :class:`DataPoints <DataPoint>`.
Timestamps can be specified in any time zone, but are converted to UTC for storage.
Timestamps with no timezone are treated as UTC.

A DataPoint's value is a double-precision floating point number.

Reading raw data
----------------

There are many functions for reading and analyzing sensor data in TempoIQ. One
of the simplest is to read raw data from a selected device over a time range.
